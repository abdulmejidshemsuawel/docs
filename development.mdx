<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: To use the PostSyncer API, you need an active PostSyncer account with API access enabled. All API plans include a free tier to get started.
</Info>

## Getting Started with the API

Follow these steps to begin integrating the PostSyncer API with your applications:

### Step 1: Create an API Token

1. Log in to your PostSyncer account at [app.postsyncer.com](https://app.postsyncer.com)
2. Navigate to your Account Settings
3. Scroll down to the "API Tokens" section
4. Click "Create New Token"
5. Select the permissions your integration needs:
   - `posts` - For managing social media posts
   - `accounts` - For managing connected social accounts
   - `campaigns` - For organizing posts into campaigns
   - `labels` - For categorizing posts with labels
   - `workspaces` - For accessing workspace information
6. Name your token something descriptive (e.g., "Website Integration")
7. Click "Create Token" and securely store the generated token

<Warning>
  Your API token is displayed only once. Be sure to copy and store it securely, as it provides access to your PostSyncer account.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Make Your First API Request

Once you have your API token, you can begin making requests to the PostSyncer API. All requests should include your token in the Authorization header:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://app.postsyncer.com/api/v1/workspaces" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const fetchWorkspaces = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://app.postsyncer.com/api/v1/workspaces', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
      }
    });
    
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching workspaces:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
};

fetchWorkspaces();
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
}

response = requests.get('https://app.postsyncer.com/api/v1/workspaces', headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common Use Cases

Here are some popular ways to use the PostSyncer API:

### 1. Automated Content Publishing

Set up your system to automatically create and schedule posts based on your business logic. This is useful for:

- E-commerce businesses posting new products
- News sites sharing breaking stories
- Content feeds that need to be shared on social media

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const createPost = async (content, imageUrl, scheduleTime) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://app.postsyncer.com/api/v1/posts', {
      workspace_id: 1,
      content: content,
      media_urls: [imageUrl],
      schedule_for: scheduleTime,
      accounts: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    console.log('Post created:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating post:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
};

// Example usage
createPost(
  'Check out our new product!',
  'https://example.com/images/new-product.jpg',
  '2023-12-15T15:30:00Z'
);
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Content Calendar Integration

Integrate PostSyncer with your content calendar or CMS to streamline your content workflow:

- Automatically create social media posts when new blog articles are published
- Schedule social media campaigns alongside your marketing calendar
- Sync content across your website and social platforms

### 3. Performance Analytics

Pull data from PostSyncer to incorporate social media metrics into your custom dashboards:

- Analyze post performance across platforms
- Track campaign effectiveness
- Generate custom reports for clients or stakeholders

## Rate Limiting

To ensure system stability, the PostSyncer API enforces rate limits:

- Free tier: 60 requests per minute
- Professional tier: 120 requests per minute
- Enterprise tier: 300 requests per minute

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement proper error handling and backoff strategies in your applications.

## Testing Your Integration

We recommend testing your integration in a controlled environment before deploying to production:

1. Create a separate workspace in your PostSyncer account for testing
2. Generate a test API token with limited permissions
3. Run test scenarios against this workspace
4. Verify the expected behavior in the PostSyncer dashboard
